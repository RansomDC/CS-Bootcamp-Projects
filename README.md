## C# and .NET Course Projects
This is a collection of the different projects and practice files that I worked on during the C# and .NET course of the Tech Academy Software Developer Bootcamp. The range of completion for all of these is variable, some are in a state of fully complete, most are in a limbo state where I did the minimum to create the functionality that I wanted so that I could learn the important aspects efficiently and without distraction.

Here is a summary of the different folder and what they contain projects:
* Assignments
* ConsoleApplication Assignment-Maths
A very simple application for performing basic math functions in C#
* * Test
