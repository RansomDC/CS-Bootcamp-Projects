## C# and .NET Course Projects
This is a collection of the different projects and practice files that I worked on during the C# and .NET course of the Tech Academy Software Developer Bootcamp. The range of completion for all of these is variable, some are in a state of fully complete, most are in a limbo state where I did the minimum to create the functionality that I wanted so that I could learn the important aspects efficiently and without distraction.

Here is a summary of the different folder and what they contain projects:
* Assignments
  * ConsoleApplication Assignment-Maths
    - A very simple application for performing simple math functions in C#
  * Log-and-Read-Assignment
    - Another simple example of logging to a file and reading from a file
  * Parameters-Assignment
    - A program exploring how parameters work in C#
  * Struct-Assignment
    - A program exploring the creation and use of structs in C#
  * TryCatch-Assignment
    - Learn about utilizing Try/Catch blocks
* Basic_C#_Programs
